Usage:
  > filter input.wav output.wav -<type> -f:n [-f2:n] -df:n [-a:n] [-norm]

Options:
  input.wav  - file to process
  output.wav - file to write the result to
  -<type> - filter type:
    -lowpass  - low pass filter
    -highpass - high pass filter
    -bandpass - band pass filter
    -bandstop - band stop filter
  -f    - center frequency of the filter (all filters)
  -f2   - second bound frequency (bandpass and bandstop filters only)
  -df   - transition band width
  -a    - attenuation factor in dB (100dB by default)
  -norm - if this switch is present all frequecies are specified in
          normalized form instead of Hz.
  -dither - dither the result

Examples:
  Band-pass filter from 100Hz to 8kHz with transition width of 100Hz.
  Attenuate all other frequencies (0-50Hz and 8050 to nyquist) by 100dB.
  > filter in.wav out.wav -bandpass -f:100 -f2:8000 -df:100 -a:100

  Low-pass half of the total bandwidth with 1%% transition bandwidth.
  Note, that in normalized form nyquist frequency is 0.5 (not 1.0!), so half
  of the bandwidth is 0.25 and 1% of the bandwidth is 0.005.
  For 48kHz input, this means low-pass filter with 12kHz cutoff frequency
  and 240Hz transition band width.
  > filter in.wav out.wav -lowpass -f:0.25 -df:0.005
