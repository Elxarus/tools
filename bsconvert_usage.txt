Bitstream converter
===================
This utility conversts files between numerous MPA/AC3/DTS stream types:
SPDIF padded, 8/14/16bit big/low endian. By default, it converts any
stream type to the most common byte stream.

This utility is a part of AC3Filter project (http://ac3filter.net)

Usage:
  Detect file type and print file information:
  > bsconvert input_file

  Convert a file:
  > bsconvert input_file output_file [format]

Options:
  input_file  - file to convert
  output_file - file to write result to
  format      - output file format:
    8     - byte stream (default)
    16le  - 16bit low endian
    14be  - 14bit big endian (DTS only)
    14le  - 14bit low endian (DTS only)

Notes:
  File captured from SPDIF input may contain several parts of different type.
  For example SPDIF transmission may be started with 5.1 ac3 format then
  switch to 5.1 dts and then to stereo ac3. In this case all stream parts
  will be converted and writed to the same output file

  SPDIF stream is padded with zeros, therefore output file size may be MUCH
  smaller than input. It is normal and this does not mean that some data was
  lost. This conversion is loseless! You can recreate SPDIF stream back with
  'spdifer' utility.

  14bit streams are supported only for DTS format. Note, that conversion
  between 14bit and non-14bit changes actual frame size (frame interval),
  but does not change the frame header.
