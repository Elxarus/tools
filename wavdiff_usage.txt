WAVDiff
=======
Finds the difference between 2 audio files. Calculates amplitude difference
and RMS difference. Can compare files of different types, like PCM16 and
PCM Float (number of channels and sample rate must match). Can write
the difference into the difference file. May check maximum difference for
automated testing

This utility is a part of AC3Filter project (http://ac3filter.net)

Usage:
  > wavdiff a.wav b.wav [-diff c.wav] [-max_diff:n] [-max_rms:n] [-max_mean:n]

Options:
  a.wav - First file to compare
  b.wav - Second file to compare
  c.wav - Difference file
  -max_diff - maximum difference between files allowed (dB)
  -max_rms  - maximum RMS difference between files allowed (dB)
  -max_mean - maximum mean difference between files allowed (dB)

Example:
 > wavdiff a.wav b.wav -diff c.wav -max_rms:-90
 Comapre a.wav and b.wav and write the difference into c.wav
 If the difference between files is more than -90dB exit code will be non-zero
