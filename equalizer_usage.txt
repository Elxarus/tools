Usage:
  > equalizer input.wav output.wav [-fx:n] [-gx:n]

Options:
  input.wav  - file to process
  output.wav - file to write the result to
  -fx - center frequency in Hz for band x (100 bands max)
  -gx - gain in dB for band x (100 bands max)
  -dither - dither the result

If gain for a band specified with -fx parameter is not set, 0dB is assumed

Example:
 > equalizer a.wav b.wav -f1:100 -g1:-6 -f2:200 -g2:3 -f3:500
 Attenuate all frequencies below 100Hz by 6dB, gain the band with the center
 at 200Hz by 3dB, and leave everything after 500Hz unchanged
